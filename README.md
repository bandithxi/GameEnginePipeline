# GameEnginePipeline
This is a repository containing my Unity and Orge code for game development class.

There are various python scripts and a webpage source here. All scripts are assumed to be working. However, some projects may require asset file paths to be changed.

All projects were either written by myself or using my professor's starter code as a project constraint. Will be labeled as such.
